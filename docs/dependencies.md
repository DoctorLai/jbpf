# Install dependencies

To build *jbpf* or to integrate it into your own project, you will need to install various dependencies. 
This process is documented with [Dockerfiles](../deploy) for Ubuntu and Azure Linux distributions that are used for *jbpf* pipeline tests. 
The `deploy/<distro_name>.Dockerfile` builds *jbpf*, following similar process as described in [README](../README.md) (but also runs extra pipeline checks).

Please note that it is your responsibility to secure the software supply chain by carefully managing the software versions. 
See [here](./security.md) for more discussion.
